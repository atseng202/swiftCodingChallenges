// MARK: - Challenge 57: Isomorphic values
// Easy
// Function that accepts two values and returns true if they are isomorphic
// Each value must map to precisely one other, but that might be itself
// Tip: "tort" and "pump" are isomorphic b/c the two t's can be replaced with a p, the o with a u, the r with an m.
